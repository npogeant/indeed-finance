# An Indeed analysis about Finance

This projet is basically looking to analyse Indeed data with the keyword "Finance" to understand better what the field looks like.

## The data

The data are 3 extractions from the software "Octoparce" using Us Indeed, Uk Indeed and CA Indeed.

## Analysis

The jupyter notebook "Indeed & Finance.ipynb" in the repository is the main jupyter notebook I created for the analysis.

I also wrote an [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-break-into-finance-indeed-python-5cca7637e114?sk=a5f58bd2c6e058c6209c8dc07f7697b2) on medium about the analysis I did with the results I got.
