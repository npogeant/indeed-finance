> An analysis about Finance Job Posts with Indeed

The question behind the project is : **Can we understand the Financial Job Market ?**

The project attempts to analyse Indeed data with the keyword "Finance" and understand better what the field looks like.

## The data

Data are 3 scrapped pages from Indeed with the software "Octoparce" in The United States, The United Kingdom and Canada.

## Analysis

The jupyter notebook **[Indeed & Finance](https://nbviewer.org/github/npogeant/amzn2019/blob/main/Main_Analysis_AMZN.ipynb)** in the repository is a large part of the analysis from the descriptive one to the opinion mining.

This is an example of the Visualization I got :

I also wrote an **[article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-break-into-finance-indeed-python-5cca7637e114?sk=a5f58bd2c6e058c6209c8dc07f7697b2)** on medium about the analysis I did with the results I got.
